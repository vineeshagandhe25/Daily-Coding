Problem Statement: AI-Powered Age Verification System: 
Context:
Many online platforms restrict access to users under 18 due to legal and ethical concerns related to adult content, gambling, alcohol sales, or mature discussions. However, traditional age verification methods (self-reported birthdates, checkboxes) are easily bypassed. This leads to underage users accessing inappropriate or harmful content, posing regulatory and safety risks for businesses.
Problem:
Current age verification methods lack robust security and are easily manipulated by minors. Websites relying on simple date-of-birth inputs or social media logins cannot effectively verify a user’s real age. There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can accurately determine a user's age using advanced methods like facial recognition, document verification, and behavioral analysis.
Proposed Solution:
An AI-powered age verification system that uses facial recognition, machine learning, and document verification to ensure that only users above the required age can access restricted content. The system will:
•	Analyze facial features to estimate age using deep learning.
•	Verify government-issued IDs with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI-based fraud detection.
•	Ensure real-time authentication by detecting spoofing attempts (e.g., using a photo instead of a real face).

Abstract: AI-Powered Age Verification System
With increasing concerns over minors accessing age-restricted content, traditional verification methods such as self-reported birthdates are insufficient. This project introduces an AI-powered age verification system that ensures accurate and secure authentication using facial recognition, document scanning, and AI-driven fraud detection.
The system first captures a user’s face via a webcam or mobile camera and applies deep learning models to estimate age. If further verification is required, the system requests a government-issued ID, which is processed using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI-based fraud detection to ensure legitimacy. Additionally, anti-spoofing measures such as liveness detection and biometric analysis prevent attempts to bypass the system using photos or deepfake videos.
This project integrates advanced AI models for real-time verification while maintaining high security, scalability, and compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, COPPA). By implementing machine learning-based age estimation and document validation, the solution significantly improves access control for age-restricted content, reducing legal risks for online platforms.
