Problem-Solving Recipe in Coding

1. Analyze the Problem

Carefully read and understand the problem statement.

Identify the given input and the expected output.

Determine constraints (time limit, space limit, edge cases).

Break the problem into smaller subproblems if possible.



2. Find an Initial Approach

Think of a simple way to convert input to output (brute-force method).

Use example test cases to check if your approach works.

Verify correctness before moving forward.



3. Implement the Solution

Write clean and structured code based on your approach.

Test the code with sample and edge cases.

Debug any errors that arise.



4. Optimize the Solution

Analyze time and space complexity (Big-O notation).

Identify inefficiencies and refine the approach.

Use efficient data structures (arrays, hashmaps, trees, heaps, graphs).

Apply problem-solving patterns (two pointers, sliding window, dynamic programming, divide & conquer, greedy, etc.).



5. Document and Review

Add meaningful comments and a short problem description.

Check for readability, modularity, and reusability of code.

Discuss potential improvements if needed.

Recipe for Writing Clean, Well-Structured, and Readable Code

1. Understand the Code Requirements

Clearly define what the code should achieve.

Identify the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints.

Decide on the best approach before coding.



2. Plan the Code Structure

Break down the code into modules and functions for better readability.

Follow OOP principles if applicable (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).

Keep a single responsibility per function/class to improve maintainability.



3. Write Meaningful and Simple Code

Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., calculateTotalPrice() instead of calc()).

Keep functions small and focused (each function should perform only one task).

Use proper indentation and spacing to improve readability.

Write modular code so that it can be reused and extended easily.



4. Follow Best Practices

Use comments wisely – Explain why, not what (code should be self-explanatory).

Avoid magic numbers – Use constants instead (TAX_RATE = 0.08 instead of 0.08).

Use appropriate data structures to optimize performance.

Follow DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) – avoid redundant code.



5. Error Handling and Validation

Always handle edge cases and unexpected inputs.

Use proper exception handling (try-except in Python, try-catch in Java).

Validate inputs before processing them.



6. Optimize the Code

Analyze time and space complexity.

Remove unnecessary computations or redundant loops.

Use efficient algorithms and data structures where needed.



7. Test the Code Thoroughly

Write test cases for different scenarios (positive, negative, edge cases).

Use unit tests and debugging tools to verify correctness.



8. Document and Review

Add a brief description at the top explaining the purpose of the code.

Write docstrings/comments for complex functions or logic.

Review the code for improvements and refactor if necessary.




By following this structured approach, your code will be clean, maintainable, and easy to understand for other programmers.
