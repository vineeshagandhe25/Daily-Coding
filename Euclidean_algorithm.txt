In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm,[note 1] or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers), 
the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it in his Elements (c. 300 BC).
 It is an example of an algorithm, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules, and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use.
  It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.
  The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is commonly
   expressed as (O(\log(\min(a, b)))), where (a) and (b) are the two input integers.Here's a brief explanation of why the time complexity is logarithmic:Division Steps:
   The Euclidean algorithm consists of a series of division steps.In each step, the larger number is divided by the smaller number, and the remainder becomes the new smaller
    number.The number of steps required to reach a remainder of zero is logarithmic in the size of the input numbers.
    Halving Behavior:The algorithm often exhibits a "halving" behavior, where in each step, the size of one of the numbers is significantly reduced.
    This halving behavior leads to a logarithmic number of steps.Binary Representation:The logarithmic nature is linked to the binary representation of the input numbers.
    Each division effectively removes a significant bit from one of the numbers.
