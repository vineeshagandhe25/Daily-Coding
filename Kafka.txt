Apache Kafka - Overview
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data processing. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications that handle large volumes of data efficiently.

1. Why Kafka?
Kafka is widely used because it provides:
✔ Scalability – Can handle millions of messages per second.
✔ Fault Tolerance – Data is replicated across multiple brokers.
✔ Durability – Data persistence with log-based storage.
✔ High Performance – Optimized for low-latency message processing.
✔ Decoupling of Services – Acts as a messaging backbone in Microservices.

2. Kafka Architecture
Kafka is based on a publish-subscribe model and consists of the following core components:

1️⃣ Topics & Partitions
Topics: Logical channels for organizing messages.
Partitions: Topics are divided into multiple partitions for scalability.
Offset: Each message in a partition has a unique identifier (offset).
2️⃣ Producers
Applications that write (publish) messages to Kafka topics.
Messages are distributed across partitions based on a key or round-robin.
3️⃣ Consumers & Consumer Groups
Consumers read (subscribe) messages from topics.
They can be grouped into consumer groups for parallel processing.
4️⃣ Brokers
Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers (servers).
Each broker stores a subset of partitions and handles message distribution.
5️⃣ Zookeeper
Manages metadata, leader election, and broker coordination in Kafka.
3. How Kafka Works?
1️⃣ Producers send messages to a Kafka topic.
2️⃣ Kafka stores messages in partitions across multiple brokers.
3️⃣ Consumers read messages in order (based on offset).
4️⃣ Kafka ensures durability & fault tolerance by replicating data across brokers.

4. Kafka Use Cases
✔ Log Aggregation – Collecting logs from multiple sources.
✔ Real-Time Analytics – Processing financial transactions, IoT sensor data.
✔ Messaging System – Used as a message broker alternative to RabbitMQ.
✔ Event-Driven Architecture – Decoupling Microservices communication.
✔ Big Data Processing – Integrating with Spark, Flink, and Hadoop.
✔ Change Data Capture (CDC) – Streaming database changes in real time.

5. Key Features
✅ High Throughput & Low Latency – Handles millions of messages per second.
✅ Fault Tolerance – Data is replicated to ensure durability.
✅ Horizontally Scalable – Easily scales by adding more brokers.
✅ Durable & Persistent – Messages are stored in logs for replayability.
✅ Supports Multiple Clients – Java, Python, Go, .NET, and more.
