Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework used for building web applications. It is well-suited for beginners and small to medium-sized projects, 
and it's a favorite choice for developers because of its simplicity and extensibility.

Key Features of Flask:

1. Lightweight and Modular: Flask does not impose a specific project structure or unnecessary dependencies, giving developers full control.
2. Built-in Development Server: A simple server for testing and debugging applications.
3. Routing: Map URLs to specific functions (called views) using decorators.
4. Templating: Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic HTML pages.
5. Extension Support: Easily integrate extensions for database management, authentication, and more.
6. RESTful Request Handling: Perfect for building APIs.
7. Secure Cookies: Supports client-side sessions via signed cookies.

Basic Flask Example:

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to Flask!"

@app.route('/greet/<name>')
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

@app.route('/json', methods=['POST'])
def process_json():
    data = request.get_json()
    return jsonify({"received": data})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)


Key Concepts:

1. Routes: Define URL patterns with @app.route.
2. Templates: Use .html files with Jinja2 syntax for dynamic content.
3. Forms: Handle user inputs using Flaskâ€™s request object.
4. Static Files: Manage CSS, JS, and images in the static/ folder.
5. Blueprints: Organize large applications by grouping routes and logic.
6. Database Integration: Use Flask extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy for databases.
