Chromatic Number :
The chromatic number can be described as the minimum number of colors required to properly color any graph.
 In other words, the chromatic number can be described as a minimum number of colors that are needed to color 
 any graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices of a graph will be assigned the same color.

 The above graph contains some points, which are described as follows:
 The same color is not used to color the two adjacent vertices.
 The minimum number of colors of this graph is 3, which is needed to properly color the vertices.
 Hence, in this graph, the chromatic number = 3
 If we want to properly color this graph, in this case, we are required at least 3 colors.
