Problem Statement :
You are given an array containing N integers where only one element is unique while all other elements appears twice . Find and return the unique elemnet .
Ex : [5,3,2,3,2]
output = 5

Solution 

1. Using for loops tc O(n^2) sc O(1)
2. Using hash map tc O (n)  sc 0(n)
3. Using xor tc O (n) sc  0 (1)
arr =[2 ,3 ,4 ,2 ,3]
res = 2 ^3^4^2^3
= (2^2)^(3^3)^4
=0^0^4
=4

In a sequence of xor operations ,elements appears twice becomes zero  due to self cancellation property .

As the problem statement clearly mentions that all other elements appear twice, we can conclude that applying XOR is the correct approach.
