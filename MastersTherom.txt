Master’s Theorem for Decreasing Functions

Consider a relation of type −
T(n) = aT(n-b) + f(n)
where, a >= 1 and b > 0, f(n) is asymptotically positive
Here,
n − size of the problem
a − number of sub-problems in the recursion
n-b − size of the sub problems based on the assumption that all sub-problems are of the same size.
f(n) − represents the cost of work done outside the recursion  Θ(nk), where k >= 0.
