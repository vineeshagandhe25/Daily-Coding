Association and Clustering are two important concepts in Machine Learning (ML), both related to analyzing data, but they serve different purposes and work on different principles.

Association
Definition: Association learning focuses on finding relationships, patterns, or correlations between variables in a dataset. 
It is widely used to discover hidden patterns that frequently co-occur.

Objective: Identify if-then rules between data items.

Key Concept: Association Rules Mining

Example: Market Basket Analysis
Rule: If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter.
Rule Representation: {Bread} â†’ {Butter}
Metrics Used:
Support: Frequency of the itemset in the dataset.
Confidence: Likelihood of the rule being true.
Lift: Strength of the rule compared to random chance.


Algorithms:
Apriori
FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth)
Eclat

Applications:
Retail (Product recommendations)
Web usage mining
Fraud detection in financial systems

Clustering

Definition: Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity.

Objective: Partition a dataset into groups such that data points within a group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to points in other groups.

Key Concept: Similarity/Dissimilarity

Measured using distance metrics such as:
Euclidean distance
Manhattan distance
Cosine similarity
Types of Clustering:

Partition-based Clustering:
Example: k-Means, k-Medoids

Hierarchical Clustering:
Example: Agglomerative, Divisive

Density-based Clustering:
Example: DBSCAN, OPTICS

Model-based Clustering:
Example: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Applications:
Customer segmentation
Image segmentation
Document categorization
Anomaly detection
