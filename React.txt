We can create react apps using various methods. And now we discussing about CRA and using vite approach 

1. Bundling and Development Speed
Create React App (CRA):

Uses Webpack as its bundler and development server.
During development, Webpack bundles all your code, which can result in slower startup times and hot module replacement (HMR).
It can be slower, especially for larger projects, because Webpack needs to rebuild the entire app when code changes.
Vite:

Uses esbuild for bundling, which is significantly faster than Webpack.
For development, Vite serves files directly using native ES Modules. This leads to faster startup times, as only the files that are needed are loaded, not the entire bundle.
Vite provides near-instant HMR, making development much quicker.
2. Build Time
Create React App (CRA):

Uses Webpack for both development and production builds, which can result in longer build times, especially as the application grows.
CRA optimizes the app for production, but the build process can feel slow compared to modern tools.
Vite:

Uses esbuild for development but switches to Rollup for production builds. Both esbuild and Rollup are known for their fast build times and optimized outputs.
Vite has faster production builds due to the efficiency of its underlying tools.
