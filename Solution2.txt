Explanation
Sliding Window Approach:

We use two pointers: left (start of the window) and right (end of the window).

A HashSet is used to keep track of unique characters in the current substring.

Logic:

Move right pointer to expand the window.

If a duplicate character is found, move the left pointer forward and remove characters from the HashSet until the duplicate is removed.

Update maxLength whenever a new longest unique substring is found.

Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), since each character is processed at most twice (once added, once removed).

Space Complexity: O(min(n,26)) (since there are at most 26 unique lowercase English letters).
