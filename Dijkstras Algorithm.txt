Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular algorithms for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs 
i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph.
It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.
