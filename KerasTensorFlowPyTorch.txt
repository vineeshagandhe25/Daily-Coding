Keras
What it is:
A high-level deep learning API built on top of frameworks like TensorFlow and Theano (now mainly integrated into TensorFlow).
Designed for simplicity and fast prototyping.
Key Features:
User-Friendly: Intuitive and simple syntax, ideal for beginners.
Modular Design: Models are built by combining building blocks like layers, optimizers, and loss functions.
Support for Multiple Backends: Originally supported multiple backends (TensorFlow, Theano, etc.), but now tightly integrated with TensorFlow.
Pre-trained Models: Includes libraries like Keras Applications with pre-trained models.
Customization: Offers flexibility for advanced users by supporting custom layers, functions, and models.
Use Cases:
Quick prototyping and experimentation.
Deployment of production-ready models using TensorFlow Extended (TFX).
