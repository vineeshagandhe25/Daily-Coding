To solve the problem of finding the longest common prefix (LCP) string amongst an array of strings, 
we can follow a few common approaches. One efficient approach is the Horizontal scanning method, where we iterate over the strings and progressively compare their common prefixes.

Approach: Horizontal Scanning
Start with the first string: Consider the first string in the array as the initial common prefix.

Iterate through the rest of the strings: For each string, compare it with the current common prefix. 
Update the common prefix by checking the longest prefix that is common between the current common prefix and the string.

Stop early if there is no common prefix: If at any point, the common prefix becomes an empty string, we can return immediately.

Steps:
Initialize the common prefix as the first string.

For each subsequent string, update the common prefix by comparing it with the current prefix.

If at any point, the prefix becomes empty, return immediately.

After iterating through all strings, the common prefix will be our answer.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in the array and m is the length of the longest string. In the worst case, we compare each string character by character.

Space Complexity: O(1) .
