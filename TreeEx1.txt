Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. 

We can perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree using recursion or iteration (using a stack)

Time & Space Complexity

Recursive Approach
Time Complexity: O(n) 
Space Complexity: O(n) 

Iterative Approach
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) 

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

We can check whether two binary trees are identical by comparing their structure and node values using recursion or iteration.
