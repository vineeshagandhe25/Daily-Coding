Clique Decision problem:

A clique is a subgraph of a graph such that all the vertices in this subgraph are connected with each other that is the subgraph is a complete graph. 
The Maximal Clique Problem is to find the maximum sized clique of a given graph G, that is a complete graph which is a subgraph of G and contains the maximum number of vertices. 
This is an optimization problem. Correspondingly, the Clique Decision Problem is to find if a clique of size k exists in the given graph or not.

Problem Statement:
To prove that a problem is NP-Complete, we have to show that it belongs to both NP and NP-Hard Classes. (Since NP-Complete problems are NP-Hard problems which also belong to NP)
