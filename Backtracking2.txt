Backtracking :
Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing 
them if they lead to a dead end.
->It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem.
->When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different 
path until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

Template Idea: Make a choice , Recurse and Undo the choice (backtrack).
