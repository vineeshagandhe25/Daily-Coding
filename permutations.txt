Algorithm to find all permutations of a string

Algorithm --- 

* Base Case: If the string has only one character, return the string itself as the only permutation.
* Recursive Case:
   -> Loop through each character in the string.
   -> For the current character, fix it as the first character.
   -> Find all permutations of the remaining characters (excluding the fixed character).
   -> Append the fixed character to each of the permutations of the remaining characters.
