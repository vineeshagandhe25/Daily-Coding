WHAT IS CHERRY-PICKING A COMMIT WITH GIT?
Cherry picking in Git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch.
* In other words picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.
* Cherry picking can cause duplicate commits , so traditional merge are prefered.
* For example , if we made a commit to wrong branch then we can use Cherry pick to correct it.

HOW TO USE CHERRY-PICKING ?

step 1:
git log --oneline 
above command is used to get commits with their commit ids,so copy the commit id to Cherry-pick

step 2:
git checkout branch name (here branch isthe  branch on which you want to apply Cherry-pick)
above command is used to switch from one branch to another

step 3:
git cherry-pick commit_id (here commit_id is the thing which you have copied in step 1 )
above command is used to Cherry pick

--> You can check new commit(cherry-pick commit) with help of ls command
