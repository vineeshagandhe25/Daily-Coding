Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A binary tree is height-balanced if:
For every node, abs(height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)) â‰¤ 1, and both the left and right subtrees are also height-balanced.

Time Complexity = O(n) , n = total number of nodes in the tree
Space Complexity = O(h) , h = height of the tree
