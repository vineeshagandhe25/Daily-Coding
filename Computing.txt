1. Grid Computing
Definition: A distributed system where resources (CPU, storage, etc.) from multiple independent computers are pooled together to work on a single task or set of tasks.
Key Features:
Heterogeneous systems (different hardware, OS, etc.).
Resources are geographically dispersed.
Decentralized control (resources may belong to different organizations).
Purpose: Solving large-scale computational problems (e.g., scientific research, simulations).
Example:
SETI@home: Searching for extraterrestrial intelligence by analyzing radio signals using volunteer computers.
Advantages:
High computational power for large-scale problems.
Cost-effective (uses existing resources).
Disadvantages:
Complex to manage and configure.
High latency due to geographical dispersion.

2. Cluster Computing
Definition: A group of interconnected computers (nodes) working together as a single system to perform tasks.
Key Features:
Homogeneous systems (similar hardware and OS).
Resources are centralized and often in the same location.
Centralized control and management.
Purpose: High availability, scalability, and fault tolerance in applications.
Example:
Googleâ€™s server clusters for handling search queries.
Advantages:
Low latency due to proximity of nodes.
High reliability and scalability.
Disadvantages:
High setup cost (dedicated hardware and maintenance).
Limited geographical distribution.

3. Cloud Computing
Definition: A model for delivering computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Key Features:
Resources are virtualized and on-demand.
Highly scalable and elastic.
Accessible via the internet from anywhere.
Purpose: Providing flexible and scalable computing services for various applications (businesses, individuals, etc.).
Example:
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform.
Advantages:
No need for infrastructure management.
Cost-effective (pay-as-you-go model).
Scalable and globally accessible.
Disadvantages:
Dependency on internet connectivity.
Security and privacy concerns.
