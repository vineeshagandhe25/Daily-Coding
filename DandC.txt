Divide and conquer is an algorithmic technique that solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. 
Each of these subproblems is solved independently, and their solutions are combined to form the final solution. The approach consists of three main steps:

Divide: Break the original problem into smaller subproblems.
Conquer: Solve each subproblem recursively.
Combine: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.
Classic examples of divide and conquer algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search.
