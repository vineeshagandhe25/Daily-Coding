OOPS is a programming paradigm based on objects encapsulating data and methods.It enables modular,reusable code and offers a
structured approach to problem-solving.Objects are derived from classes,which serve as blueprint with data members and methods.

-> The four pillars of OOPS :
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism 
* Abstraction

Inheritance : Is a mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class,promoting code reuse and efficiency.
It includes various types such as single,muitiple,muitilevel,hierarchical and hybrid inheritance.

Polymorphism : allows objects to take on multiple forms based on the context,achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

Encapsulation : hides data and methods within a class,restricting access modifiers,enhancing code security and reliability .

Abstraction : focuses on exposing only the essential functionalities of an object while hiding the complex implementation details.
It cab be implemented through abstract classes and interfaces.
