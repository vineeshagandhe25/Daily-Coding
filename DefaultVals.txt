Pros and Cons of Each Approach

1. Initialization During Declaration:

Pros:
Simpler and shorter, especially for default values.
Avoids repetitive code if you have multiple constructors.

Cons:
If different constructors need different default values, you would need to override these values in each constructor.
Makes the default value less flexible, as changing it requires editing the declaration line.


2. Initialization in the Constructor:

Pros:
More flexibility if you have multiple constructors (e.g., some with parameters and some without).
Keeps initialization logic in one place, making it easier to modify defaults later without editing each field's declaration.

Cons:
Slightly more verbose for simple defaults.

Which is Better?
It depends on the use case:

If you have a single default value and don’t expect it to change, initializing during declaration is usually simpler and clearer.
If you have multiple constructors or may need more flexible initializations, it’s often better to initialize in the constructor.
In this specific case, if you’re using the same default values across all constructors, initializing in the declaration is likely 
the more concise approach. However, if you later decide that Room could have variable default dimensions, initializing in the constructor provides more control.
