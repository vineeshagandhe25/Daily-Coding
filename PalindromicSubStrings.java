/*Problem statement
You have been given a string STR. Your task is to find the total number of palindromic substrings of STR.

Example :
If the input string is "abbc", then all the possible palindromic substrings would be: ["a", "b", "b", c", "bb"] and hence, 
the output will be 5 since we have 5 substrings in total which form a palindrome. */
