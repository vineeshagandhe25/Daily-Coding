The Traveling Salesperson Problem

TSP problem is as follows:
Let G = (V,E) be directed graph with edge costs  Cij.	Cij>0 for all i and j and Cij = +∞ if <i,j>      E.
Let |V |= n and assume n>1.
A tour of G is a directed cycle that includes every  vertex in V.
The cost of a tour is the sum of the cost of the edges on the tour.
The TSP problem is to find a tour of minimum  cost.

Solution:

Form the principle of optimality, it follows that  
   g(1, V-{1})= min{C1k+g(k,V-{1,k})}	……(1)
	 				(forward approach)
In general, for i   S, g(i, S)= min{Cij+g(j, S-{j})}………..(2)  j    s
(1) may be solved for g(1, V-{1}) if we know g(k,  V-{1,k}) for all choices of k.
These values are obtained from (2)
g(i, Ø) = Ci1 1≤i≤n.
g(i, Ø) is the length of the shortest path starting at i  going through no vertex and ending at 1.
