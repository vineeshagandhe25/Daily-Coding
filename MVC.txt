The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a widely used architectural design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. 
This separation allows for modular development, improved scalability, and easier maintenance. Here’s a breakdown of the three components:

1. Model
Role: Represents the application's data, business logic, and rules.
Responsibilities:
Directly manages the data and logic of the application.
Responds to requests for information (from the controller or view).
Updates the state of the application when the controller or user input modifies the data.
Example: A database or API handling user information in a user management system.

2. View
Role: Displays the data to the user and collects user input.
Responsibilities:
Handles the user interface (UI).
Presents data fetched from the model in a readable and interactive format.
Updates in response to changes in the model.
Example: HTML pages or graphical UI components showing data to the user.

3. Controller
Role: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
Responsibilities:
Handles user input from the view and updates the model accordingly.
Fetches data from the model and decides which view to render.
Contains the application’s control flow logic.
Example: A class/method that processes form submissions and updates the database.

How it Works
User Interaction: A user interacts with the View (e.g., clicks a button).
Controller Processing: The Controller receives this input, processes it, and interacts with the Model if needed.
Model Update: The Model updates the application state based on the input from the Controller.
View Update: The View reflects the updated data from the Model.

Benefits of MVC
Separation of Concerns: Each component has a specific responsibility, making the code modular.
Reusability: Views can be reused with different models, and vice versa.
Scalability: Easy to add or modify components independently.
Maintainability: Clear structure makes debugging and enhancements easier.
Example in Action

Suppose you’re developing a To-Do List Application:
Model: The list of tasks (stored in a database or in-memory array).
View: A web page displaying tasks and forms to add/delete tasks.
Controller: Handles adding/deleting tasks based on user input and updates the Model.
