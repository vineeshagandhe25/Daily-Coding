Big Data Analytics is the process of examining large and complex data sets (big data) to uncover patterns, correlations, trends, and other valuable insights. 
It combines advanced technologies, statistical methods, and analytical techniques to enable data-driven decision-making across various industries. Below is an overview:

Key Features of Big Data Analytics
Volume: Handles massive amounts of data generated from multiple sources like social media, IoT devices, sensors, and logs.
Velocity: Processes data at high speeds to analyze streaming data in real-time.
Variety: Works with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, including text, images, videos, and more.
Veracity: Deals with the uncertainty and inconsistencies in data to ensure reliable results.
Value: Extracts actionable insights to drive business strategies and innovation.

Big Data Analytics Lifecycle
Data Collection: Gathering data from multiple sources such as databases, logs, sensors, or social media platforms.
Data Processing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.
Data Storage: Storing data using tools like Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
Data Analysis: Using statistical and machine learning algorithms to analyze data.
Visualization: Presenting insights using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or custom dashboards.

Types of Big Data Analytics
Descriptive Analytics: Provides summaries and trends from historical data.
Example: Monthly sales reports.
Diagnostic Analytics: Identifies reasons for past events by examining data.
Example: Root cause analysis of customer churn.
Predictive Analytics: Uses historical data and machine learning to forecast future trends.
Example: Predicting product demand.
Prescriptive Analytics: Suggests optimal actions based on data-driven insights.
Example: Recommending supply chain adjustments.
