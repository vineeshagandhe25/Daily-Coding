• Backtracking is nothing but the modified process of the brute force approach.
• Where the technique systematically searches for a solution to a problem among all available options.
It does so by assuming that the solutions are represented by vectors (v,..., v) of values and by traversing through the domains of the vectors until the solutions is found.


Algorithm
Backtrack(X[1.../])
if X[1...] is a solution then write X[1...];
exit
else
for each X[1...i+1] that is promising do Backtrack(X[1...i+1])
