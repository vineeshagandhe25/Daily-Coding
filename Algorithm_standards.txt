Algorithm standards refer to a set of criteria or guidelines that an algorithm should meet to ensure its effectiveness, efficiency, and usability. 
These standards help in evaluating and comparing algorithms for various applications.

Key Algorithm Standards

Correctness:
The algorithm must solve the problem as intended and produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
Example: A sorting algorithm should always return a correctly sorted list.

Finiteness:
The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
Example: Infinite loops or unending recursion violate this standard.

Efficiency:
Time Complexity: The algorithm should minimize the time taken to execute.
Space Complexity: The algorithm should use memory efficiently.
Example: QuickSort is faster than Bubble Sort for larger datasets due to its lower time complexity.

Clarity and Simplicity:
The algorithm should be easy to understand and implement.
Example: A well-documented and structured algorithm is easier to maintain and debug.

Generality:
The algorithm should work for a wide range of inputs, not just specific cases.
Example: A binary search algorithm works for any sorted dataset, regardless of its size.

Robustness:
The algorithm should handle invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully without crashing.
Example: A division algorithm should check for division by zero and handle it appropriately.

Scalability:
The algorithm should perform well even as the input size grows.
Example: Algorithms with linear or logarithmic time complexity scale better than those with exponential complexity.

Determinism:
The algorithm should produce the same output for the same input every time.
Example: A deterministic algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) always produces the same result.

Adaptability:
The algorithm should be adaptable to different hardware, platforms, or environments.
Example: Parallel algorithms can take advantage of multi-core processors.

Portability:
The algorithm should be implementable in different programming languages without major changes.

Maintainability:
The algorithm should be easy to update or modify to accommodate changes or improvements.
Example: Modular design with clearly defined steps makes maintenance easier.


Algorithm Evaluation Metrics
To assess whether an algorithm meets these standards, we often measure:

Big-O Notation: For time and space complexity.
Accuracy: How often the algorithm produces correct results.
Edge Case Handling: How well it manages boundary conditions or unexpected inputs.
Runtime Benchmarks: Actual performance on various input sizes.
