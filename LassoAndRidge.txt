Lasso and Ridge

#Lasso
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target
# Train Lasso model
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.01).fit(X, y)

# Get selected features
selected_features = [data.feature_names[i] for i in np.where(lasso.coef_ != 0)[0]]
print("Lasso Selected features:", selected_features)

#Ridge
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target
# Train Ridge model
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0).fit(X, y)

# Threshold for selecting significant features (e.g., coefficients > 0.1 in magnitude)
threshold = 0.1
selected_features = [data.feature_names[i] for i in range(len(ridge.coef_)) if abs(ridge.coef_[i]) > threshold]
print("Ridge Selected features based on threshold:", selected_features)
