Design & Implement the following scenario:
 Draw a class diagram, and use case diagram for the library system. Discuss your 
design decisions, and any limitations of your model. For each book held by the 
library, the catalogue contains the title, author's name and ISBN of the book. There 
may be multiple copies of a each book and each copy with unique accession 
number. Registered readers belonging to the library, each of whom is issued with a 
number of tickets. The system records the name and address of each reader, and the 
number of tickets that they have been issued with. Readers can borrow one book for 
each ticket that they possess, and the system keeps a record of which books a reader 
has borrowed, along with the date that the book must be returned by. Readers can 
borrow, return and renew books from the library by forwarding a ticket to the 
library staff at the library desk. Readers have an option of purchasing additional 
tickets from the library. Any book that is not returned by the due date is subject to a 
fine of Rs.1 per day. Library staff is responsible for collecting fines, adding new 
books to the library.

To draw class diagram we need to understand and should decode the scenario into classes with their own attributes and behaviour .
Then identifying and establishing relationships between classes.

To draw Use case diagram we have identify actors and coressponding usecases.
