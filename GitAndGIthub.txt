What's the difference between Git and GitHub?

The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally
on their personal computers, while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud.

How GitHub is different from Git

GitHub has built an entire ecosystem of DevOps tools around the Git tooling that promises to make developers, software teams and organizations more productive. 
Additional tools GitHub provides over and above their Git hosting service include the following:

A web-based interface to make Git easier to use.
GitHub Actions to help users create CI/CD pipelines.
GitHub Pages for free website hosting.
Branch protection rules for increased security.
Pull request workflows to help merge and rebase code.
Code scanning to identify known vulnerabilities.
GitHub Desktop to simplify push, pull and fetch operations.
Software team administration tools.
GitHub Copilot for AI-based peer programming.
Social media functionality that lets users follow other developers.
GitHub constantly expands its suite of software development-related tools. 
In stark contrast, the Git tool has achieved a remarkable state of stability, and other than minor tweaks to the APIs, very few changes.
