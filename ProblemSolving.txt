To solve any coding question effectively, follow these structured steps:

1. Understand the Problem
Read carefully: Read the problem statement multiple times to fully grasp the requirements and constraints.
Clarify inputs and outputs: Identify what the input is, and what output is expected.
Understand constraints: Take note of any time or space constraints.
Look for edge cases: Think of unusual or extreme inputs that could break your solution.

2. Plan a Solution
Break down the problem: Break the problem into smaller steps or parts.
Choose an approach: Based on the problem type (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming), choose the right algorithmic approach.
Write pseudocode: Outline your solution in plain language or pseudocode.
Think of edge cases: Consider if your approach handles edge cases like empty inputs, negative numbers, or maximum limits.

3. Write the Code
Start simple: Begin by coding the simplest part of the solution.
Follow your pseudocode: Use the pseudocode you wrote as a guide.
Use meaningful variable names: Keep your code readable and clean.

4. Test the Code
Test with sample inputs: Use example test cases provided with the question.
Edge case testing: Try to test the code with edge cases and large inputs.
Debug: If the code fails, use print statements or a debugger to trace the problem.

5. Optimize the Solution
Analyze complexity: Determine the time and space complexity (Big O notation) of your solution.
Look for improvements: If the solution is slow or uses too much memory, think of ways to optimize it.

6. Refactor Code
Clean up: Remove unnecessary comments, improve readability, and ensure the code follows best practices.
Modularize: Break the solution into functions or methods to make it reusable and maintainable.

7. Submit and Review
Submit: If you're working on an online coding platform, submit the solution.
Review the feedback: If it fails test cases, rework your approach using feedback.

By following this structured process, you can systematically approach and solve coding problems effectively.

-> In general, effective problem-solving strategies include the following steps:

Define the problem.
Come up with alternative solutions.
Decide on a solution.
Implement the solution.

1. Trial and error
2. Heuristics
3. Gut instincts (insight problem-solving)
4. Working backward
5. Means-end analysis
