What is a UML diagram ? 
UML means Unified Modeling Language and it’s a standardized visual language used most often in, but not exclusively, software development, IT and business systems.

-> UML class diagrams are used to show and define a system’s static classes, attributes, methods and relationships between classes.
1. Define the purpose and scope
2. Identify and label classes
3. Add attributes
4. Add methods

As for those symbols: +,-, # or ~, they’re the visibility of that attribute or method and its access privileges to other classes.
– = Private, meaning no accesses from other classes
+ = Public, accessible to other classes
# = Protected, accessible by the same class or subclasses
~ = Package, can be used by any class in the same package

5. Show relationships --- Inheritance , Association , Aggregation , Composition and Dependency .
6. Add multiplicity notation (if necessary) 

The way we show that on the structure diagram is as follows:

0..1 = zero to one
1 = exactly one
0..* = zero to many
1..* = one to many
n..m = specific number range 

7. Review and Refine
